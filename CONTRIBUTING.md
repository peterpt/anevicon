# Contributing
Since Anevicon is a free (in sense of freedom) kind of software, you are always welcome to contribute! Please look through our [code of conduct](https://github.com/Gymmasssorla/anevicon/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and the liberal [GPLv3 license](https://github.com/Gymmasssorla/anevicon/blob/master/LICENSE), under which the product is distributed. Below are some rules which you must follow.

## Where to go?
 - **[Issues](https://github.com/Gymmasssorla/anevicon/issues)** are meant for reporting found bugs, errors, and maybe grammar mistakes. You can also push your issues to suggest new functionality in what you interested in. Discussions are welcome too, and I will try to answer you in near future.
 
 - **[Pulls](https://github.com/Gymmasssorla/anevicon/pulls)** are meant for implementing new functionality, fixing bugs, errors, and maybe grammar mistakes. You can suggest your work without asking for permission or any other coordination. Other people can criticize your code, and you should answer them.
 
 ## How to format?
To make code easy to read for any contributor, there is a great tool called [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) by the original Rust team, which formats a whole project just in one command (`cargo fmt`). Please type this command before pushing any changes to this repository.

## How to test?
Now Anevicon has the most important tests without which the reliable code is simply impossible. But more tests is more safeness, so your new tests are always more than welcome. You can run the existing tests using the `cargo test` command.
